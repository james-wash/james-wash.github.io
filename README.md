## Welcome!

Hi, I'm James Wash, and this is my personal website. I thought it would be an interesting idea to create my own Github page as a hub for all my little creative endeavors online. If you're interested, be sure to check out some of my projects and let me know what you think!

### My Youtube Channel:
I like to make Youtube videos from time to time, about my many different interests. So far I have made videos about mathematics videos, jokes, research presentations, and more. I'm always looking for new and different projects to explore.

### My Programming Projects:
A hobby I've had in the past, and would like to pick up again in the future, is programming. I wouldn't do it for a living, but I love to put together some of my own little stupid projects with it. Here are some of my project pages on Github:
* [Random Mixtape Maker](https://james-wash.github.io/Random-Mixtape-Maker/) - a Python program for randomly stitching music files together into varied playlists.
* [tfwYouDon'tKnowWhatYou'reDoing](https://github.com/james-wash/tfwYouDon-tKnowWhatYou-reDoing) - a small website I put together and hosted on Heroku to learn the basics of using the Flask framework - you can find the Heroku deployment [here](https://tfw-youdontknowwhatyouredoing.herokuapp.com/)
* [Bowienator](https://james-wash.github.io/Bowienator/index.html) - a small Python script I cobbled together one afternoon. Detects faces in photos, and replaces them with David Bowie. It's that simple.
* [Explorer-Director Game Minimax Algorithm](https://github.com/james-wash/the-stupidest-minimax-ever) - an implementation of the minimax algorithm that I programmed to help with research for an REU project I worked on one summer. It takes given graphs and recursively determines how many vertices an Explorer can visit in the Explorer-Director game on graphs.

### My Games:
Sometimes I like to make some little videogames in my free time. Here are some links below!
* [My GameJolt Profile](https://gamejolt.com/@GamingWalrus)
* [GROM](https://gamejolt.com/games/grom/135759) - A game made on Gamemaker: Studio inspired by the first Tron movie - has its own in-game command line, which I was inordinately proud of
* [Gem Jumpin'](https://gamejolt.com/games/gem-jumpin/159704) - Another Gamemaker: Studio game - I tried to make a more casual, app-like game about a whale trying to protect his gem from thieving birds. Not terribly good, but I like it all the same
* [The Mascot Forest](https://gamejolt.com/games/the-mascot-forest/176965) - A third Gamemaker: Studio game, and my first game jam project. You are a lonely man trying to escape a forest filled with evil sports mascots. Less "horrifying" and more "startling".
* [Climber](https://gamejolt.com/games/Climber/474728) - A Puzzlescript game, and the first game I made after going to college. A short little puzzler about climbing up and down life's mountains.
* [Racquetball](https://gamejolt.com/games/racquetball/476037) - A Godot game, a solitaire Pong variant where you can swing a racquet back and forth to have some more control over the puck as it comes back at you.
