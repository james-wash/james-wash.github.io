## Welcome!

Hi, I'm James Wash, and this is my personal website. I thought it would be an interesting idea to create my own Github page as a hub for all my little creative endeavors online. If you're interested, be sure to check out some of my projects and let me know what you think!

### My Games:
Sometimes I like to make some little videogames in my free time. Here are some links below!
* [My GameJolt Profile](https://gamejolt.com/@GamingWalrus)
* [GROM](https://gamejolt.com/games/grom/135759) - A game made on Gamemaker: Studio inspired by the first Tron movie - has its own in-game command line, which I was inordinately proud of
* [Gem Jumpin'](https://gamejolt.com/games/gem-jumpin/159704) - Another Gamemaker: Studio game - I tried to make a more casual, app-like game about a whale trying to protect his gem from thieving birds. Not terribly good, but I like it all the same
* [The Mascot Forest](https://gamejolt.com/games/the-mascot-forest/176965) - A third Gamemaker: Studio game, and my first game jam project. You are a lonely man trying to escape a forest filled with evil sports mascots. Less "horrifying" and more "startling".
* [Climber](https://gamejolt.com/games/Climber/474728) - A Puzzlescript game, and the first game I made after going to college. A short little puzzler about climbing up and down life's mountains.
* [Racquetball](https://gamejolt.com/games/racquetball/476037) - A Godot game, a solitaire Pong variant where you can swing a racquet back and forth to have some more control over the puck as it comes back at you.
